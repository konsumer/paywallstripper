# paywall stripper

This will create a light, no-ad, no-paywall version of an article. It has some ideas from [bypass-paywalls-chrome](https://github.com/iamadamdev/bypass-paywalls-chrome), but you can use it in node to strip the article down to a markdown file.

I have it deployed [here](https://paywallstripper.now.sh).
